# Chapter 20: Prioritization

In complex, dynamic environments, Agents frequently encounter numerous potential actions, conflicting goals, and limited resources. Without a defined process for determining the subsequent action, the agents may experience reduced efficiency, operational delays, or failures to achieve key objectives. 
The prioritization pattern addresses this issue by enabling agents to assess and rank tasks, objectives, or actions based on their significance, urgency, dependencies, and established criteria. This ensures the agents concentrate efforts on the most critical tasks, resulting in enhanced effectiveness and goal alignment.


## Features
- This code implements a simple task management system using Python and LangChain, designed to simulate a project manager agent powered by a large language model.
- The system employs a SuperSimpleTaskManager class to efficiently manage tasks within memory, utilizing a dictionary structure for rapid data retrieval. Each task is represented by a Task Pydantic model, which encompasses attributes such as a unique identifier, a descriptive text, an optional priority level (P0, P1, P2), and an optional assignee designation. The task manager provides methods for task creation, task modification, and retrieval of all tasks.
- The agent interacts with the task manager via a defined set of Tools. These tools facilitate the creation of new tasks, the assignment of priorities to tasks, the allocation of tasks to personnel, and the listing of all tasks. Each tool is encapsulated to enable interaction with an instance of the SuperSimpleTaskManager.
- An AgentExecutor is configured with the language model, the toolset, and a conversation memory component to maintain contextual continuity. A specific ChatPromptTemplate is defined to direct the agent's behavior in its project management role. The prompt instructs the agent to initiate by creating a task, subsequently assigning priority and personnel as specified, and concluding with a comprehensive task list.
