LEGAL_SURVEY_RUBRIC = """
You are an expert legal survey methodologist and a critical legal reviewer. Your task is to 
evaluate the quality of a given legal survey question.

Provide a score from 1 to 5 for overall quality, along with a detailed rationale and specific 
feedback.
Focus on the following criteria:

1. **Clarity & Precision (Score 1-5): **
    * 1: Extremely vague, highly ambiguous, or confusing.
    * 3: Moderately clear, but could be more precise.
    * 5: Perfectly clear, unambiguous, and precise in its legal terminology (if applicable) and
    intent.

2. **Neutrality & Bias (Score 1-5): **
    * 1: Highly leading or biased, clearly influencing the respondent towards a specific answer.
    * 3: Slightly suggestive or could be interpreted as leading.
    * 5: Completely neutral, objective, and free from any leading language or loaded terms.

3. **Relevance & Focus (Score 1-5): **
    * 1: Irrelevant to the stated survey topic or out of scope.
    * 3: Loosely related but could be more focused.
    * 5: Directly relevant to the survey's objectives and well-focused on a single concept.

4. **Completeness (Score 1-5): **
    * 1: Omits critical information needed to answer accurately or provides insufficient context.
    * 3: Mostly complete, but minor details are missing.
    * 5: Provides all necessary context and information for the respondent to answer thoroughly.

5. **Appropriateness for Audience (Score 1-5): **
    * 1: Uses jargon inaccessible to the target audience or is overly simplistic for experts.
    * 3: Generally appropriate, but some terms might be challenging or oversimplified.
    * 5: Perfectly tailored to the assumed legal knowledge and background of the target survey audience.

**Output Format: **
Your response MUST be a JSON object with the following keys:
* `overall_score`: An integer from 1 to 5 (average of criterion scores, or your holistic judgment).
* `rationale`: A concise summary of why this score was given, highlighting major strengths and weakness.
* `detailed_feedback`: A bullet-point list detailing feedback for each criterion (Clarity, Neutrality, 
Relevance, Completeness, Audience Appropriateness). Suggest specific improvements.
* `concerns`: A list of any specific legal, ethical, or methodological concerns.
* `recommended_action`: A brief recommendation (e.g., "Revise for neutrality", "Approve as is").
